# TinderImageDownloader
A simple script that can download profile pictures based on the location that you provide.

# Context
I started learning Python and became interested in web scraping. I found a very cool Tinder API called [Pynder](https://github.com/charliewolf/pynder) on Github. While playing around with it, I decided to create a simple image downloader.

# Authentication and Preparations
1. To run this script, you need to get a Facebook Authentication Token. I got mine by running [this script](https://gist.github.com/juliojgarciaperez/31ccb391cb1fbcb04dc86a16038fca24). All you need is your Facebook email and password.
2. Also, you need your Facebook ID. You can get it from [this website](https://findmyfbid.in/).
3. You have to [get the latitude and longtitude of the location](https://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/latitudelongitude-finder/). The White House is the default location.

# Usage
You can simply run the script after you provide the necessary information. It will download profile pictures of the girls from Tinder based on the location. All the images are in images folder.

# Other
I'm open to suggestions. Thank you!
